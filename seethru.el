;;; Commentary:
;; Seethru: Easily change Emacs' frame transparency
;;
;; The use of seethru is very simple. To set the transparency to an
;; absolute value:
;;
;;     (seethru 55)
;;
;; To set the transparency relative to its current value:
;;
;;     (seethru-relative -10)
;;
;; This is usually used to bind to a key, like so:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "<M-wheel-up>")
;;                     (lambda ()
;;                       (seethru-relative -10)))
;;
;; To set up recommended keybindings, which are `C-c 8' to reduce
;; transparency and `C-c 9' to increase it, as well as shifted
;; keybinds which do the same, but slower:
;;
;;     (seethru-recommended-keybinds)
;;
;; To set up mouse bindings, which are wheel-up to increase
;; transparency and wheel-down to decrease it:
;;
;;     (seethru-mouse-bindings)
;;
;; You can optionally change the modifier used by either
;; `seethru-recommended-keybinds' or `seethru-mouse-bindings' simply
;; by passing an argument in, for example:
;;
;;     (seethru-recommended-keybinds "C-x") ;; "C-x 8" and "C-x 9"
;;     (seethru-mouse-bindings "C") ;; hold control while wheeling
;;                                  ;; mouse to change transparency

;;; Code:

(require 'shadchen)

;;;###autoload

  "Sets the transparency of the currently selected Emacs
frame (0-100, where 0 is transparent and 100 is opaque)"
  (interactive "nSet transparency (0 is transparent - 100 is opaque)")
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha value))

;;;###autoload
(defun seethru-relative (value)
  (let* ((current-transparency (frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha))
         (summed-transparency (+ current-transparency value)))
    (transparency (match summed-transparency
                    ((? (lambda (x) (< x 0)) x) 0)
                    ((? (lambda (x) (> x 100)) x) 100)
                    (val val)))))
